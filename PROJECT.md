# DATA LEAK DETECTION

To check if any data is leaked, or lost and to check the source of the leakage. We'' use data tunneling on a regular basis.
# DATA TUNNELING

to transfer data in a single space, to keep a cnstant check on the data being transferred. Can be repeated to chech the data loss after each step, which helps to check where we lost the data.
# DARK DATA
Dark data is a type of unstructured, untagged and untapped data that is found in data repositories and has not been analyzed or processed. Basiaclly urequired data, that uses up space.

# Data-Leakage-Detection

Data leakage is an uncontrolled or unauthorized transmission of classified information to the outside. It poses a serious problem to companies.It is essential to discover data leakage as soon as possible, as it poses a serious threat to companies on the scale of going bankrupt. The purpose of this PROJECT is to design and implement a data leakage detection system based on special information retrieval models and methods, and also try removing the dark data. Data is to be stored in .pdf or as an image file.

Dependency Req as of now
> Python/Java
> Numpy
> DJango
> if python (pdf dependency)
> Git
> Database 
> Web (we'll use a template)
> something to mail you the data
> file generator, or a core level to have a log of all the actions taking place in the app (both Java and Python have app plugins for that)
> basic nowledge on .jsp setup. (It is a web-based file which has java in it rather than php or nodeJS)
